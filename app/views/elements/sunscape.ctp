<h2>Glass Breakage and IG Unit Seal Failure Coverage</h2>
<p>
	To qualify for the seal failure coverage, the customer must present documentation that the manufacturerâ€™s seal
	failure warranty coverage is in force at time of film installation. Installations over 1,000 square feet require
	prior Madico approval. This five year IG unit seal failure coverage will not exceed the term limits of the seal
	failure warranty coverage period provided by the manufacturer of the IG unit.
</p>
<p>
	If glass breakage or seal failure does occur as a direct result of an approved installation of an approved 
	SUNSCAPE SELECT designer film, Madico will, upon verification of coverage, replace the broken glass or insulated 
	glass unit and the window film. There is a repair or replacement limit of $500 per window. Re-installation
	of the window film will be included in the $500 per window limit.
</p>
<p>
	As a condition of coverage, this glass breakage and seal failure coverage must be registered within 30 days of
	installation commencement. Coverage is non-transferable from the original purchaser of the film and is only
	valid on approved film-to-glass applications in the United States and Canada.
</p>
<p>
	This warranty is valid only when installed by an authorized SUNSCAPE SELECT window films dealer in 
	an application approved for that product.
